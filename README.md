currently working on it (March 24, 2022), planning on updating later tonight. This will get screenshots from reddit, clip them with some gameplay in the back, with a tts and upload it to tiktok. GL getting it to work, only me and god can figure it out, if you understand python a little you should be good.

1. get reddit cookies and tiktok
2. goto main and run
3. the video will be downloaded into the rendered folder
4. upload the tiktok manually
